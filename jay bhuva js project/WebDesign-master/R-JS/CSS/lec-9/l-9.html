                <h1>Ice Cream</h1>
                <p>Ice cream is a frozen dessert typically made from milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches. Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.

                <h1>Friends</h1>
                <p>Friendship is a selfless bond between two people. Having a friend you can trust with eyes closed is God's blessing. Friendship is a devoted relation, where both get the same love, care, and priority from each other. At an early age, people come in contact with various members of the public, and they make many friends. But as time flows, there is hardly one or two true friends who stay beside you.

                    Friendship Day is celebrated on the first Sunday of August every year. There is indeed a story behind dedicating this day to Friendship. It is said that once the US government had killed a person, who had a friend who committed suicide in the sorrow of his friend's death. Honouring the depth of their Friendship, this day was named as Friendship day in America in 1935 and thus began the celebration of Friendship Day. 

                    We are moving forward in this modern era. People who cannot give time to their friends, Friendship Day motivates all those people to meet their friends. If there is no friendship between the two, no relationship can stay long.  Friendship is only possible when both people have the same interests and feelings. Friendship is the basis of every relationship. Friendship day is mainly a day to celebrate the day of togetherness and the bond between true friends. This Friendship day brings us closer to our friends and brings lots of happiness in life.
